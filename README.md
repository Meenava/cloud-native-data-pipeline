# cloud-native-data-pipeline

A handsâ€‘on mini project demonstrating a **cloudâ€‘native data pipeline** from ingestion to archival.  
It showcases **Kafka** for streaming, **MongoDB** for NoSQL storage, and **AWS S3** for longâ€‘term archival â€” all deployed on **Kubernetes**, monitored with **Prometheus & Grafana**, and enhanced with automation scripts for operational efficiency.

## ðŸ“„ Description

This project simulates a cloudâ€‘native data pipeline designed to showcase platform engineering capabilities in a modern DevOps environment. It integrates:

- **Kafka** for realâ€‘time data streaming  
- **MongoDB** for NoSQL storage  
- **AWS S3** for longâ€‘term data archival  
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration  
- **Prometheus & Grafana** for observability and alerting  
- **Python scripts** for automation of operational tasks  

The pipeline reflects realâ€‘world scenarios involving crossâ€‘functional collaboration, cloudâ€‘native deployments, and proactive incident management. It includes infrastructureâ€‘asâ€‘code via Terraform, monitoring dashboards, and automation workflows â€” making it a comprehensive showcase of cloud platform engineering.
